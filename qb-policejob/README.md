Some made a few changes to qb-policejob

Handcuff Changes:

Ive made it so when you get cuffed there is a wheel where you can break out of the cuffs
When cuffed a model will spawn on your hands
Cuff model dissapears when cuffs are taken off
Impound Changes:

If 7.0 gta distance away from a car it will say there is no car nearby, if 5.0 gta distance away from a car it will tell you to move closer to the car, if 3.0 gta distance away it will let you impound it and will show a progress bar and notifty it has been impounded (will notify for all other instances)
