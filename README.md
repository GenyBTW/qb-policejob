# qb-policejob
Some made a few changes to a r14 adapted qb-policejob

Handcuff Changes: 

- Ive made it so when you get cuffed there is a wheel where you can break out of the cuffs with a wheel 
- When cuffed a model will spawn on your hands
 
 Impound Changes: 
 
 - If 7.0 gta distance away from a car it will say there is no car nearby, if 5.0 gta distance away from a car it will tell you to move closer to the car,
  if 3.0 gta distance away it will let you impound it and will show a progress bar and notifty it has been impounded (will notify for all other instances)
